*SwiftUI Animations – Circle Pattern*

✨ A small experiment I built while learning SwiftUI animations.
This project creates a hypnotic circle pattern made of dots, animated step by step.


Motivation

I’m just getting started with SwiftUI, and this was one of my first “wow, it works!” moments.
I wanted to explore:
	•	How to animate shapes with withAnimation
	•	How to combine geometry & timing
	•	How to make simple patterns come alive
